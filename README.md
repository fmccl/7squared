# 7squared
7squared is a simple game based on a 7x7 grid. It's meant for two players, black and blue, who take turns. You can move by clicking on a cell adjacent to any of your own colour. You can win by clicking on an adjacent cell that is your enemy's colour, so you shouldn't move into vulnerable positions.

A friend and I invented the game on paper, and it's simple to play and set up with any two colours of pen. The ultimate time killer in free periods at school!
